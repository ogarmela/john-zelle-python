# Discussion Questions

# 1.

# a) Hardware is the physical part of a computer that you can touch, software is what's on the computer, computer scienctists manipulate this to use to solve problems, it's where the magic is.
# b) An algorithm is a step-by-step process designed by a programmer to solve a problem, a computer program is a detailed, step by step set of instructions telling a computer exactly what to do.
# c) A programming languange is how we can convert our english language into computer languange (binary) and includes no ambiguities, Natural language is how we normally speak and cannot convert to binary well.
# d) A high-level language like python is what we code in as it uses commands we can understand, machine languane makes no sense to us as it is in binary.
# e) An interpreter acts like the code was compiled and run in a programming language environment, a compiler converts the code to machine language so that it can be run but not understood.
# f) Syntax is the precise form of a programming language and it's exactly how you have to write the code. Semantics is the meaning of the code and what it does.

# 2.

#   Input device = mouse or keyboard that controls what the inputs things to the computer
#   CPU = the brains of the computer, filled with trasistors that are either off or on
#   Main memory = RAM. Where programs are stored that the computer is currently working on.
#   Secondary memory = slower memory such as an HDD or SDD where files are stored that are not in use, large capacities.
#   Output devices = shows the output of the computer such as video output in the case of a monitor, or digital sound into a DAC into a pair of headphones.

# 3.

# Locate bread
# If no bread
#   Go to store and buy some
# else
#   Put the bread on the table
